# Sensor-Final-project

Detecting a human body, distance and direction Indoor and outdoor system

We developed the whole system on the Arduino UNO, using three ultrasonic measurement modules to achieve a different direction of detection of the human body, sound detection module, fire sensor to any detect fire accident. 
For the design to be more human, the system establishes the feedback of the LED light of the signal, the user can always pay attention to the state of the system signal.
